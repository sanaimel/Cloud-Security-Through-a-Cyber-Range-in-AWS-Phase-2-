## 📘 Overview  
This project establishes a **cloud-native cybersecurity training lab** within AWS that simulates real-world **Red Team (offensive)** and **Blue Team (defensive)** operations.  
It demonstrates secure cloud architecture, automated deployments, and proactive threat detection — combining **hands-on technical execution** with **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** alignment.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To design a **secure, automated AWS cyber range** that enables:  
- Realistic **attack and defense simulations**.  
- Automated **threat detection and remediation**.  
- Application of **least privilege, encryption, and continuous monitoring** best practices.
